# Userspace driver for the G13

## This is a 100% boost free version
You no longer need to rebuild this every other week when boost updates. It started out as a quick rewrite but has turned out to be a refactoring job gone wild. It is not completely refactored but I have so far:

* Removed all dependencies on boost libraries
* Fixed a couple of bugs (and probably introduced some others)
* Merged some work on adding support for additional keys and mouse clicks
* Added support for USB hotplugging
* Moved from regular Makefile to CMake
* Refactored by splitting up huge source files into smaller parts
* Renamed lots of stuff to start transitioning towards something more like Mozilla coding style

## Changelog
* v1.0.4
  * Fixed a major bug in LCD init (thanks to [nihilman](https://github.com/nihilman))
  * Fixed a small memory leak on hotplug disconnect
  * More methods renamed for style
* v1.0.3
  * Major refactoring work continued
    (I just wanted something to show here as to not look too empty)
* v1.0.2
  * I really can't recall but lots
* v1.0.1
  * Somewhere here boost got killed off
* v1.0.0 Started a version scheme


## Installation

Make sure you have ~~boost~~ log4cpp, libevdev and libusb-1.0 installed.

### For Archlinux

Install [g13-git from AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/g13-git/)

### Building from source
#### For Mint 20 ####
* ***sudo apt install liblog4cpp5-dev libevdev-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev libgmock-dev***

```
$ cd <sourcedir>
$ cmake -B build -S .
$ cd build
$ make
```

If you want to Run the daemon as user, put the file 91-g13.rules into /etc/udev/rules.d/ (or whatever directory your distribution uses).

## Running


Connect your device, then Run ./g13d, it should automatically find your device.

If you see output like

    Known keys on G13:

             STICK_DOWN   { 0 x 0.7 / 1 x 0.9 }   SEND KEYS: DOWN
             STICK_LEFT   { 0 x 0 / 0.2 x 1 }   SEND KEYS: LEFT
            STICK_RIGHT   { 0.8 x 0 / 1 x 1 }   SEND KEYS: RIGHT
           STICK_PAGEUP   { 0 x 0 / 1 x 0.1 }   SEND KEYS: PAGEUP
         STICK_PAGEDOWN   { 0 x 0.9 / 1 x 1 }   SEND KEYS: PAGEDOWN



that is good. This also shows you which name the keys on the G13 have, and what keys you can bind them to.

### Command line options

The following options can be used when starting g13d

Option 				|  Description
--------------------|-------------------------------------------------
 --help             | show help
 --logo *arg*       | set logo from file
 --config *arg*     | load config commands from file
 --pipe_in *arg*    | specify name for input pipe
 --pipe_out *arg*   | specify name for output pipe

## Configuring / Remote Control

Configuration is accomplished using the commands described in the [Commands] section.

Commands can be loaded from a file specified by the --config option on the command line.  

Commands can be also be sent to the command input pipe, which is at ***/tmp/g13-0*** by 
default. Example:

    echo rgb 0 255 0 > /tmp/g13-0

### Actions

Various parts of configuring the G13 depend on assigning actions to occur based on something happening to the G13. 
* key, possible values shown upon startup  (e.g. ***KEY_LEFTSHIFT***).
* multiple keys,  like ***KEY_LEFTSHIFT+KEY_F1***
* pipe output, by using ">" followed by text, as in ***>Hello*** - causing **Hello** (plus newline) to be written to the output pipe ( **/tmp/g13-0_out** by default )
* command, by using "!" followed by text, as in ***!stick_mode KEYS*** 

## Commands

### rgb *r* *g* *b*

Sets the backlight color

### mod *n*

Sets the background light of the mod-keys. *n* is the sum of 1 (M1), 2 (M2), 4 (M3) and 8 (MR) (i.e. 13 
would set M1, M3 and MR, and unset M2).

### bind *keyname* *action*

This binds a key or a stick zone. 
* The possible values of *keyname* for keys are shown upon startup (e.g. G1).
* The possible values of *action* are described in [Actions].

### stickmode *mode*

The stick can be used as an absolute input device or can send key events. You can change modes to one of the following:

Mode       | Description
-----------|---------------------------
KEYS       | translates stick movements into key / action bindings
ABSOLUTE   | stick becomes mouse with absolute positioning
RELATIVE   | not quite working yet...
CALCENTER  | calibrate stick center position
CALBOUNDS  | calibrate stick boundaries
CALNORTH   | calibrate stick north
  
### stickzone *operation* *zonename* *args*

defines zones to be used when the stick is in KEYS mode

Where *operation* can be

operation | what it does
----------|----------------
add       | add a new zone named *zonename*
del       | remove zone named *zonename*
action    | set action for zone, see [Actions]  
bounds    | set boundaries for zone, *args* are X1, Y1, X2, Y2, where X1/Y1 are top left corner, X2/Y2 are bottom right corner 

Default created zones are LEFT, RIGHT, UP and DOWN.

Zone boundary coordinates are based on a floating point value from 0.0 (top/left) to 1.0 (bottom/right).  When the 
stick enters the boundary area, the zone's action ***down*** activity will be fired.  On exiting the boundary, the
action ***up*** activity will be fired.  

Example:

    stickzone add TheBottomLeft
    stickzone bounds TheBottomLeft 0.0 0.9 0.1 1.0
    stickzone action KEY_END

### pos *row* *col*

Sets the current text position to *row* *col*.  
* *row* is specified in characters (0-4), as all fonts are 8 pixels high and rows start on pixel row 0, 8, 16, 24, or 32
* *col* is specified in pixels (0-159)

### out *text*

Writes *text* to the LCD at the current text position, and advances the current position based on the font size

### clear

Clears the LCD

### textmode *mode*

Sets the text mode to *mode*, current options are 0 (normal) or 1 (inverted)

### refresh

Resends the LCD buffer

### profile *profile_name*
    
Selects *profile_name* to be the current profile, it if it doesn't exist creating it as a copy of the current profile.

All key binding changes (from the bind command) are made on the current profile.
  
### font *font_name*   

Switch font, current options are ***8x8*** and ***5x8***    

### dump *all|current|summary*

Dumps G13 configuration info to g13d console

### log_level *trace|debug|info|warning|error|fatal*

Changes the level of detail written to the g13d console 

### LCD display

Use pbm2lpbm to convert a pbm image to the correct format, then just cat that into the pipe (cat starcraft2.lpbm > /tmp/g13-0).
The pbm file must be 160x43 pixels.
